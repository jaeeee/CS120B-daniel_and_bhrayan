Daniel Kwong and Bhrayan Escobar

# Notes
Below are some notes for personal use 
* `ssh [username]@bolt.cs.ucr.edu` - to connect to UCR server
* `ssh wch136-0x` - for direction connection to lab machines, need to be inside a UCR server initially before you can do this.
* `make test` - to generate and run tests for the program
* `/usr/csshare/pkgs/cs120b-avrtools/createProject.sh` - runs project creation bash script
